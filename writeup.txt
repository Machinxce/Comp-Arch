This programs utilizes fork() and pipe() system calls. The initial thread of the program created a pipe 
for communication between process then fork to create the child process.I generally followed the started code and 
began modifiying it as suggested by the Professor. My code runs as its supposed to as shown on 
the help pdf. Overall I had no issues with this program.
